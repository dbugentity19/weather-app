# Weather App

Welcome to Weather App! This application provides weather forecasts for any location you choose, helping you plan your weekly events with confidence. You can get your daily forecast or repeating weekly weather predictions, all in one app.

## Features

### Location-Based Weather Forecasts

**Enter Any Location:** Upon entering the app, you will be prompted to enter the location for which you want to see the weather forecast. Simply type the name of the city or area, and the weather data will be displayed.

### Forecast Display

**Weather Charts:** Once you enter a location, the current weather and a set of charts displaying temperature, humidity, and other relevant data will be shown for the selected location.

### Forecast Options

**15-Day Forecast:** You can choose to see the weather forecast for the first 15 days starting from the current day. This data will be displayed on a carousel/slider, allowing you to easily navigate through the days.

**Recurring Weekly Forecast:** If you need to check the weather for a repeating event, select a day of the week from the dropdown menu (e.g., every Monday, every Tuesday, etc.). This will show you the weather for that specific day of the week over the next several weeks.
